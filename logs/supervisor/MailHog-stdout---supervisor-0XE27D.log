Next, visit the page where the error was caught (http://piklist.local/wp-admin/post.php?post=46\u0026action=edit) and check for any visible issues.\r\n\r\nPlease contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further.\r\n\r\nIf your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.\r\n\r\nhttp://piklist.local/wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode\u0026rm_token=mJBBUaHcU7LCiwhY3aOfSg\u0026rm_key=i2PmsWFEAHEURDwAbco90k\r\n\r\nTo keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nError Details\r\n=============\r\nAn error of type E_PARSE was caused in line 26 of the file /app/public/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/piklist/parts/meta-boxes/tax.php. Error message: syntax error, unexpected 'array' (T_ARRAY), expecting ',' or ')'\r\n",

Next, visit the page where the error was caught (http://piklist.local/wp-admin/post.php?post=46\u0026action=edit) and check for any visible issues.\r\n\r\nPlease contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further.\r\n\r\nIf your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.\r\n\r\nhttp://piklist.local/wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode\u0026rm_token=mJBBUaHcU7LCiwhY3aOfSg\u0026rm_key=i2PmsWFEAHEURDwAbco90k\r\n\r\nTo keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nError Details\r\n=============\r\nAn error of type E_PARSE was caused in line 26 of the file /app/public/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/piklist/parts/meta-boxes/tax.php. Error message: syntax error, unexpected 'array' (T_ARRAY), expecting ',' or ')'\r\n",
